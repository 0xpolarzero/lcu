"""A translated drag has a time budget that follows its path, and a timed-out one leaves nothing pressed.

LCU bounds every original call (LCU_LINUX_INPUT_CALL_TIMEOUT_MS, here 3 s). A translated drag adds 20 ms per
path point and 2 ms per pixel of path length to that bound, so a long valid drag is not killed halfway; and when
a translated call does time out after it pressed Button1 (or a held modifier), LCU releases what the call itself
pressed with XTEST before it stops the worker, so a later pointer motion cannot continue the drag.

1. A 500-point drag takes about 5 s with the original engine (about 10 ms per point), longer than the 3 s base
   bound, and must complete with its release delivered (the fixture's drag-end) and the same engine process.
2. A 60-point drag with a held Shift is started; the real engine process is stopped (SIGSTOP) as soon as the X
   server reports Button1 pressed. The call times out at its budget (about 4.3 s). The X server must then report
   no pointer button and no Shift pressed, the drag area must have received the release (drag-end), and the engine
   must be replaced. The oracles are the X server's own input state and the fixture's files.
