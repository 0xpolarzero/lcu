## Computer Use

Control native apps and browsers on the user’s computer by reading or operating UI. Prefer purpose-built connectors, APIs, or CLIs when available.

- Use `js` (JavaScript) for all UI actions.
- Do not use other technologies besides `js` for computer interactions, unless specifically requested by the user.
- Prefer a dedicated plugin or skill when it can complete the task; use Computer Use for interactions that are not exposed through a more specific interface.
- `js` state is persistent across calls
- If you get an app, the initial UI state is automatically included in the tool result.

## API

```typescript
type Vec2 = [x: number, y: number];
type ObservationOptions = { emit?: boolean };
type StateOptions = ObservationOptions & { disableDiffing?: boolean };
type StateAndScreenshot = { state: string; screenshot?: Uint8Array };
type PasteOptions = { format?: "text" };
type ClickOptions = { mouseButton?: MouseButton; clickCount?: number };
type Direction = "up" | "down" | "left" | "right" | "u" | "d" | "l" | "r";
type MouseButton = "left" | "right" | "middle" | "l" | "r" | "m";

interface Target {
  getAXState(options?: StateOptions): Promise<string>;
  getScreenshot(options?: ObservationOptions): Promise<Uint8Array>;
  getAXStateAndScreenshot(options?: StateOptions): Promise<StateAndScreenshot>;
  click(target: number | Vec2, options?: ClickOptions): Promise<void>;
  drag(from: Vec2, to: Vec2): Promise<void>;
  scroll(target: number | Vec2, direction: Direction, distance?: { pixels: number }): Promise<void>;
  performSecondaryAction(elementIndex: number, action: string): Promise<void>;
}

type AppInfo = {
  id: string;
  displayName?: string;
  lastUsedDate?: string;
  useCount?: number;
  isRunning?: boolean;
  windows?: WindowInfo[];
};
type WindowInfo = { id: number; app: string; title?: string };

interface App extends Target {
  scroll(
    target: number | Vec2,
    direction: Direction,
    distance?: { pixels: number },
  ): Promise<void>;
  paste(text: string, options?: PasteOptions): Promise<void>;
  pressKey(key: string): Promise<void>;
  typeText(text: string): Promise<void>;
}

type State = {
  apps: AppInfo[];
  browsers: [];
  errors?: string[]; // Inventory failures.
};

declare const cua: {
  getState(options?: ObservationOptions): Promise<State>;
  computer: {
    target: "linux";
    launch_app(input: { app: string }): Promise<void>;
  };

  getApp(target: { windowId: number }): Promise<App>;
  listApps(options?: ObservationOptions): Promise<AppInfo[]>;
  listWindows(options?: ObservationOptions): Promise<WindowInfo[]>;
  rewriteDocumentation(): Promise<void>;

};
```

## Native apps

On Linux, use `cua.getApp({ windowId: 123 })` with an exact open window ID from the app inventory. If an app has multiple windows, use their titles to choose the requested one. Do not choose the first window without checking it.

`cua.listWindows()` is available on Linux and includes open windows that have no app entry. If the requested app has no open window, launch its inventory ID with `await cua.computer.launch_app({ app: appId })`, then refresh the inventory and select a window. `getApp` does not launch apps on Linux.

Linux input stays bound to the selected window. Sky sends it without activating that window or moving the desktop pointer. The app can still activate a new window or grab the pointer during a held click, drag, or menu interaction. Coordinates are relative to the selected window.

## Workflow

After performing one or more UI actions, call `getAXState()` before deciding what to do next. This keeps you in the current UI state and forces you to re-derive fresh element indices from the latest accessibility text instead of reusing stale ones.
After a screenshot-only observation, request a full tree before relying on accessibility indexes again.
Linux always returns full accessibility state. Linux reports the tree source. `at_spi` elements support the actions listed in the tree; `x11` fallback elements are observation-only, so use a screenshot and window-relative coordinates for input.
Minimize model and tool round trips while retaining fresh UI state:

- Batch deterministic actions and the resulting `getAXState()` into one call. You may interact with the UI and return the updated state in that same call, so this does not require a separate tool call.
- Calling `cua.getApp(...)` returns an app binding and automatically displays the latest AX state after it runs.
- If a standalone `getAXState()` reports no accessibility-tree change, do not immediately repeat it without an intervening action. Use `getScreenshot()`, `getAXStateAndScreenshot()`, or `{ disableDiffing: true }` only when you can identify missing context that representation should provide.
- Prefer a directly relevant result already visible in the current state over opening broader intermediate UI such as “Show All.”
- Once the requested result is visibly present, stop exploring and respond.
  Perform one or more actions, and then fetch the latest state:

```typescript
await target.click(42);
await target.typeText("hello");
await target.pressKey("Return");
await target.scroll(42, "down", { pixels: 500 });
await target.scroll([640, 480], "down", { pixels: 500 });
await target.performSecondaryAction(42, "Expand");
await target.getAXState();
```

## Output

- For text output, use `nodeRepl.write(...)`. The API accepts strings and other values. Use `JSON.stringify(...)` when you want JSON.
- For image output, use `nodeRepl.emitImage(...)`. The API accepts data or file URLs, PNG/JPEG/WebP bytes, or `{ bytes, mimeType }`.
- The following APIs output their result internally, calling `nodeRepl.write(...)` and/or `nodeRepl.emitImage(...)` will duplicate the output: `getAXState()`, `getScreenshot()`, `getAXStateAndScreenshot()`, `cua.getState()`, `cua.getApp(...)`, and `cua.listApps()`. Pass `{ emit: false }` to observation and discovery methods to disable their result output. First-use documentation is still displayed.
- `cua.listWindows()` also displays its result unless `emit: false`.

## Notes

- For efficiency, prefer element index based actions over coordinate actions whenever an accessibility element is available. If AX actions are not available or not working, fall back to using screenshots and coordinate actions. You can also get a screenshot if you need visual context.
- Linux app `paste` supports only `text` and uses the platform's native text input. Prefer `paste` for multiline text.
- On Linux, omit the distance for the native default or pass `{ pixels: 500 }`. Linux element clicks support one left or right click. Use coordinates for other click options.
- `selectText` is unavailable on Linux. `setValue` is unavailable on Linux. These methods throw before sending input. Use the supported bound actions to edit the UI and verify the result.
- If the UI is not behaving as expected, try fetching the latest `getAXState()` to make sure you have the latest context.
- `performSecondaryAction()` is for invoking an accessibility action that an element exposes besides a normal click, such as expanding a disclosure row, showing a menu, incrementing a control, or cancelling something. It requires an action actually exposed for that element in the accessibility text. Do not guess action names.
- `pressKey()` presses a key or key combination, including modifier and navigation keys. It supports xdotool-style key syntax. Examples: `"a"`, `"Return"`, `"Tab"`, `"super+c"`, `"Up"`, and `"KP_0"` for numpad `0`.
- `getAXState()`, `getScreenshot()` and `getAXStateAndScreenshot()` automatically wait an appropriate amount of time before capturing new state. In order to complete the task as quickly as possible, don’t pause or delay (ex: `setTimeout(...)`) before getting UI state. Instead, rely on the internal wait.

Persist until the request is fully completed end-to-end. Attempting an action is not completion: verify that the returned UI state visibly shows the requested result. If an action leaves the state unchanged, produces no results, or only reaches an intermediate page, try another approach. Respond only after the requested page, information, or state is visibly present, or explain a concrete blocker you cannot resolve.
